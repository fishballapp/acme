`@fishballpkg/acme` is a zero-dependency, minimalistic, opiniated Automatic
Certificate Management Environment (ACME) client written in TypeScript from
scratch. We aim to simplify certificate generation by removing the need to deal
with cryptographic options, external tools like OpenSSL, or other low-level
details.

This client makes obtaining a certificate for your domain easy. The steps can be
broken down to:

1. Create an account with the Certificate Authority (CA)
2. Place an order to the CA
3. Complete the DNS-01 challenge
4. Get your certificate

This client is intentially INFLEXIBLE. No freedom of choice over encryption
algorithms, key sizes, certificates attributes, key formats. We have made most
of the choices for you. So that you can focus on what actually matters, your
application.

## Supported Platforms

This is built primarily for Deno.

But since this is built in 100% TypeScript with no dependencies, it is
compatible with all modern JavaScript platforms that support the [WebCrypto] and
[fetch].

## Features

- Zero Dependencies: Built from the ground up in TypeScript, with no external
  dependencies AT ALL.
- Minimalistic Design: Focuses on a small, essential feature set to keep things
  lightweight and manageable.
- Unapologetically OPINIONATED, so you donâ€™t have to be.
  - Keys are created with [ECDSA P-256], a modern standard in creating
    encryption keys.
  - The only challenge we support is [DNS-01 Challenge], the most versatile
    challenge type in our opinion. This challenge type works for any service,
    supports wildcard certificates, and avoids complex server configurations by
    operating at the DNS level.

[DNS-01 Challenge]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-8.4

## Why?

While building a multi-tenant SaaS with Deno, I noticed that many services
offering multi-tenancy impose restrictive certificate generation quotas for
custom domains. I was hesitant to pay for what should essentially be a free
service, so I decided to create my own solution.

Though many third-party tools and libraries handle this, I wanted something that
stayed entirely within the Deno environment without needing to call into the
shell.

Existing JavaScript ACME clients felt outdated and unnecessarily complex, with
some relying on custom encryption implementations that seemed both inefficient
and insecure.

So, I built my own ACME client in TypeScript, leveraging modern JavaScript
features like [WebCrypto] and [fetch] to keep things clean, simple, and
efficient.

## Brief introduction to ACME process and the APIs

We have built a [simple CLI tool](./examples/acme-cli.ts) that would allow you
to obtain a certificate by following the steps of ACME.

Here is a summary of the steps and API involved:

### 0x00: Add @fishballpkg/acme

```bash
$ deno add @fishballpkg/acme
```

Run the above command to add this package to your `deno.json`.

### 0x01: Initialize the client

```ts
import { ACME_DIRECTORY_URLS, AcmeClient } from "@fishballpkg/acme";

const acmeClient = await AcmeClient.init(
  ACME_DIRECTORY_URLS.LETS_ENCRYPT_STAGING,
);
```

This step fetches the ACME directory from your given URL. An [ACME directory] is
like a menu for ACME client, instructing the client where to create account,
where to place an order etc.

While you can provide any ACME directory, we've included a few well-known ones
in the [`ACME_DIRECTORY_URLS` object](./src/ACME_DIRECTORY_URLS.ts).

[ACME directory]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555#section-7.1

### 0x02: Create an account

```ts
// ...

const account = await acmeClient.createAccount({ email: "yo@fishball.app" });
```

To create an account with the CA, you must provide an email address. Although
this is not required by the ACME specification and some CAs, it is generally
considered a good practice to do so as it allows the CA to reach out for
important notifications, such as certificate expiration reminders or policy
changes.

### 0x03: Create order and get the challenges

```ts
// ...

const order = await account.createOrder({
  domains: ["fishball.app"],
});

const dns01Challenges = order.authorizations.map((authorization) =>
  authorization.findDns01Challenge()
);
```

You can provide multiple domains when creating an order. The first domain in the
list will be used in the Common Name (CN) of the certificate and the whole list
of domains (including the first) would be used in Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
field of the certificate. This allows the certificate you obtain later to work
for all those domains.

`AcmeOrder#authorizations` represent "your proof of control over the domains in
the order". For each domain you provide, you will get an authorization object.

`authorization.findDns01Challenge()` finds you the `dns-01` challenge in that
authorization.

### 0x04: Find out how to update your DNS record

```ts
// ...
const {
  type, // "TXT"
  name, // "_acme-challenge.yourdomain.com"
  content, // A string value to put into your DNS record to prove your control over the domain.
} = await dns01Challenge.getDnsRecordAnswer();
// or
const txtRecordContent = await dns01Challenge.digestToken();
```

These 2 methods basically does the same thing, except `.getDnsRecordAnswer()`
provides slightly more guidance on how to the DNS record should be set up.

### 0x05: Submit challenges and finalize it!

```ts
// updated DNS record

await challenge.submit();

await order.pollStatus({
  pollUntil: "ready",
  onBeforeAttempt: () => {
    console.log("this runs before every attempt");
  },
  onAfterFailAttempt: () => {
    console.log("this runs after every fail attempt");
  },
});

const certKeyPair = await order.finalize();
```

Once you have updated your DNS record according to the
`await challenge.digestToken()`, you can now submit the challenge!

After submitting the challenge, you can use `acmeOrder.pollStatus()` to ensure
your order is `"ready"`, meaning that the CA has verified your challenge.

Once the order status is `"ready"`, finalize the order by calling
`order.finalize()`. Under the hood, a
[Certificate Signing Request (CSR)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2986)
is generated and submit it to the CA. The CA would then verify and sign it,
that's your certificate.

The private key for the CSR / the certificate you are going to obtain is
available at `certKeyPair.privateKey`.

### 0x06: Download your CERTIFICATE!!!!

```ts
//...

await order.pollStatus({ pollUntil: "valid" });

const certificatePemContent = await order.getCertificate();
```

After finalizing the order, poll for order status `valid`. Once it's valid, the
certificate is ready to be fetched! Simply call `await order.getCertificate()`

## Workflows

Workflows are some predefined common patterns to interact with the ACME client.

### `requestCertificate`

This workflow will perform these steps:

1. Create a new order
2. Set the dns records required for the challenges
3. Poll the dns until the records are verified
4. Submit the challenge
5. Poll until the order is `ready`
6. Finalize the order by submitting a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
7. Poll until the order is `valid`
8. Retrieve the certificate

This workflow essentially bundles step `0x02` all the way to `0x06` in 1
function call.

```ts
import {
  ACME_DIRECTORY_URLS,
  AcmeClient,
  AcmeOrder,
  AcmeWorkflows,
} from "@fishballpkg/acme";

const client = await AcmeClient.init(
  ACME_DIRECTORY_URLS.LETS_ENCRYPT_STAGING,
);

const acmeAccount = await client.createAccount({ email: EMAIL });

const {
  certificate,
  certKeyPair,
  acmeOrder,
} = await AcmeWorkflows.requestCertificate({
  acmeAccount,
  domains: DOMAINS,
  updateDnsRecords: async (dnsRecords) => {
    // ... update dns records
  },
});

console.log(certificate); // Logs the certificate in PEM format
```

## ðŸ¤«

I have to admit â€” though I suppose it's no longer a secret â€” I'm particularly
proud of the CSR generation. It's something I never imagined myself
implementing, but after hours of deep-diving into ASN.1 syntax, countless
trial-and-error attempts, and reading through hundreds of octets, here we are!

What's even more exciting is that the CSR we generate is virtually identical to
the one produced by openssl. In fact, we compare the CSR we generate to the one
generated by openssl in our tests. You can find out more
[here](./src/utils/generateCSR.test.ts).
